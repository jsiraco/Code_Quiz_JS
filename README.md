# Code_Quiz_JS
## The purpose of this application is to provide the user with a timed quiz on javascript fundamentals. The application will have multiple questions and once the quiz is completed the user will be able to log their score and intials.
### This application was built with the goal of keeping all HTML and JS seperate. If I were to do to this again, I would not limit myself in such a way.
